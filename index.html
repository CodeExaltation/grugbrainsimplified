      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This collection of thoughts on software development is gathered by Grug,
        a brainy developer with a penchant for simplicity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grug, while not claiming to be the smartest, has programmed for many
        long years, accumulating a mix of wisdom and perpetual confusion. In an
        attempt to distill these learnings into a digestible and humorous
        format, Grug has created this page. The goal is not just for the benefit
        of young Grugs but also to serve as a memory aid, given that as Grug
        gets older, remembering breakfast or whether pants were worn becomes a
        challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Big-brained developers are abundant, and not all may appreciate Grug's
        perspective, resulting in some sour faces. Grug acknowledges that
        opinions may differ but insists that it's a free country, sort of, and,
        at the end of the day, the specifics may not matter too much. The hope
        is that you enjoy reading and perhaps learn from the many mistakes Grug
        has made over a long programming career.
      </p>

      <h2>The Eternal Enemy: Complexity</h2>
      <p>
        The apex predator of Grug is complexity, and Grug declares, "Complexity
        bad." Repeating, "Complexity very bad," Grug illustrates the preference
        for a one-on-one encounter with a T-rex over dealing with complexity.
        Grug identifies complexity as a spirit demon that infiltrates codebases,
        often through well-meaning non-Grug-brain developers and project
        managers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grug emphasizes the dangers of complexity, which can turn a manageable
        codebase into an incomprehensible maze overnight. Grug advocates for
        saying "no" as the best weapon against the complexity spirit demon,
        preventing unnecessary features, abstractions, and other complexities
        from creeping into the code.
      </p>

      <h2>Saying No</h2>
      <p>
        The best weapon against the complexity spirit demon is the magic word:
        "no." Grug advises saying "no" to building unnecessary features,
        abstractions, or succumbing to the pressure of constant change. While
        "yes" may be a powerful career move, Grug maintains that "no" is the
        magic Grug word, crucial for maintaining a manageable codebase over the
        long term.
      </p>

      <h2>Saying ok</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes compromise is necessary, and Grug recommends saying "ok" in
        such situations. However, Grug advises careful consideration and
        recommends building an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20</a>
        solution to the problem, delivering most value while keeping the
        complexity spirit demon at bay. Grug acknowledges that compromise is
        sometimes necessary, especially when the alternative means sacrificing
        essential needs like dinosaur meat for young Grugs at home.
      </p>

      <h2>Factoring Your Code</h2>
      <p>
        Grug emphasizes the importance of breaking the codebase properly (or
        "factoring your code") but cautions against doing it too early in a
        project. Grug suggests waiting until the project has taken shape, and
        cut points naturally emerge from the codebase. Grug advocates for
        patience and skill development in identifying appropriate cut points,
        avoiding premature abstractions that may lead to refactor failures.
      </p>

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Grug expresses a love/hate relationship with testing, acknowledging its
        importance but cautioning against blindly following test shamans. Grug
        recommends writing tests after the prototype phase when the code has
        firmed up, with a focus on in-between tests or integration tests that
        strike a balance between correctness and ease of debugging. Grug
        emphasizes the value of a well-curated end-to-end test suite for
        critical features, cautioning against excessive mocking in tests.
      </p>

      <h2>Agile</h2>
      <p>
        Grug shares thoughts on Agile, considering it not terrible but
        cautioning against the influence of Agile shamans. Grug emphasizes the
        dangers of blindly following Agile processes without considering
        practical factors. Grug recommends focusing on prototyping, tools, and
        hiring good Grugs as keys to successful software development, with Agile
        serving as a helpful organizational framework but not a silver bullet.
      </p>

      <h2>Refactoring</h2>
      <p>
        While acknowledging the benefits of refactoring, Grug warns against
        large refactors that can often lead to more harm than good. Grug
        recommends keeping refactors relatively small and waiting until the code
        has stabilized. Grug suggests using end-to-end tests to catch issues
        during refactoring and highlights the potential pitfalls of introducing
        too much abstraction, citing examples from the past.
      </p>

      <h2>Chesterton's Fence</h2>
      <p>
        Grug heeds the wisdom of Chesterton's Fence, advising against tearing
        out code without understanding its purpose. Grug recommends taking the
        time to understand the system before making significant changes,
        emphasizing the importance of humility and respect for the existing
        code, even if it appears imperfect.
      </p>

      <h2>Microservices</h2>
      <p>
        Grug questions the wisdom of introducing network calls in microservices,
        considering it a confusing addition to the already challenging task of
        factoring a system correctly. Grug wonders why big brains would take the
        hardest problem and make it more complex by adding network calls.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Grug expresses love for tools and emphasizes their role in enhancing
        productivity. Grug recommends investing time in learning and improving
        tools, citing the importance of features like code completion and
        debugging tools. Grug underscores the value of a good debugger, urging
        new programmers to delve deeply into its features for a better
        understanding of code and computer systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Type Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Grug appreciates type systems for making programming easier, especially
        for their magic pop-up suggestions. Grug cautions against the potential
        dangers of big-brained type system enthusiasts who focus too much on
        correctness rather than the practical benefits of type systems. Grug
        emphasizes the value of type systems in providing suggestions while
        coding.
      </p>

      <h2>Expression Complexity</h2>
      <p>
        Grug shares an evolution in coding style, transitioning from minimizing
        lines of code to favoring a more readable and debug-friendly approach.
        Grug highlights the importance of breaking down complex conditional
        expressions into simpler parts for easier debugging and understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>DRY</h2>
      <p>
        Grug respects the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>
        principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) but recommends a balanced approach,
        acknowledging that some repeated code may be acceptable, especially if
        it simplifies the overall structure. Grug notes a shift in concern over
        time, with a willingness to accept some repeated code in favor of
        simplicity.
      </p>

      <h2>Separation of Concerns (SoC)</h2>
      <p>
        Grug shares thoughts on Separation of Concerns (SoC), expressing
        skepticism about the concept. Grug prefers the idea of "locality of
        behavior" and argues that putting code on the thing that does the thing
        is often clearer and more straightforward than separating concerns
        across multiple files.
      </p>

      <h2>Closures</h2>
      <p>
        Grug appreciates closures for specific use cases, such as abstracting
        operations over a collection of objects. However, Grug warns against
        excessive use of closures, comparing them to salt, type systems, and
        generics—small amounts go a long way, but too much can spoil things.
      </p>

      <h2>Logging</h2>
      <p>
        Grug is a huge fan of logging and encourages its extensive use,
        especially in cloud deployments. Grug shares tips on effective logging,
        including logging major logical branches within code, including request
        IDs for spanning requests, and making log levels dynamic for better
        control in different scenarios.
      </p>

      <h2>Concurrency</h2>
      <p>
        Grug admits to fearing concurrency but recommends relying on simple
        concurrency models where possible. Grug favors the optimistic
        concurrency model, particularly for web-related tasks, as it simplifies
        the mental model and reduces the chances of deadlocks.
      </p>

      <h2>Optimizing</h2>
      <p>
        Grug discourages premature optimization and stresses the importance of
        concrete performance profiling before diving into optimization efforts.
        Grug warns against focusing solely on CPU performance and advocates
        considering other factors, such as network performance, in optimization
        efforts.
      </p>

      <h2>APIs</h2>
      <p>
        Grug values good APIs for their simplicity and emphasizes the importance
        of layering APIs at different complexity levels. Grug criticizes overly
        abstract and big-brained API designs, advocating for straightforward and
        practical approaches that make it easy for Grugs to understand and use
        the APIs.
      </p>

      <h2>Parsing</h2>
      <p>
        Grug expresses a preference for recursive descent parsing over parser
        generator tools, citing the latter's tendency to generate convoluted and
        hard-to-debug code. Grug provides practical advice for parsing and
        recommends Bob Nystrom's book on Crafting Interpreters for those
        interested in diving deeper into the topic.
      </p>

      <h2>The Visitor Pattern</h2>
      <p>
        Grug succinctly dismisses the Visitor Pattern as "bad," providing no
        further elaboration. It seems Grug is not a fan.
      </p>

      <h2>Front End Development</h2>
      <p>
        Grug criticizes front-end development for its tendency to complicate
        things unnecessarily. Grug advises keeping front-end complexity low,
        avoiding excessive use of JavaScript libraries, and favoring simpler
        approaches for better maintainability and understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>Fads</h2>
      <p>
        Grug urges caution when embracing new development fads, emphasizing the
        importance of learning from history and not falling for recycled bad
        ideas. Grug acknowledges that not all new ideas are bad but recommends a
        healthy skepticism and critical evaluation before jumping on the latest
        bandwagon.
      </p>

      <h2>Fear Of Looking Dumb</h2>
      <p>
        Grug encourages transparency and admits when something is too complex,
        setting an example for others to do the same. Grug addresses the common
        fear of looking dumb in the development community, reassuring young
        Grugs that feeling like an impostor is a normal part of the programming
        journey.
      </p>

      <h2>Impostor Syndrome</h2>
      <p>
        Grug acknowledges the prevalence of impostor syndrome in the development
        field. Grug shares personal experiences and advises young Grugs not to
        be discouraged by feelings of inadequacy, emphasizing that impostor
        syndrome is a common aspect of a programming career.
      </p>

      <h2>Reads</h2>
      <p>
        Grug recommends various readings, including articles and books covering
        topics like Worse is Better, Software Design Philosophy, and others.
        Grug encourages the continuous pursuit of knowledge and learning from
        the experiences of others in the field.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Grug concludes with a resounding statement: "complexity very, very bad."
        The overarching theme throughout the compilation is the detrimental
        impact of unnecessary complexity on codebases and the importance of
        simplicity in software development. Grug hopes that the insights shared
        will be helpful to fellow developers, whether they have Grug-like brains
        or not.
